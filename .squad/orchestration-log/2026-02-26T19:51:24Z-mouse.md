- Fixed test compilation issues across multiple test files

## Outcome

✅ **SUCCESS** — All test infrastructure issues resolved:
- All assertion methods now return correct types for method chaining
- All builder methods properly construct domain objects
- Test compilation successful
- Test suite ready for execution by Cypher
