# Orchestration Log Entry

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-26T19:16:12Z  
**Agent:** Cypher (Validator)  
**Mode:** background  
**Requested by:** Leonardo Moreira

## Task Routed

Run full test suite after UUID initialization fix

## Why This Agent

Cypher validates correctness. After Mouse's infrastructure fix, need to verify all tests pass and the UUID adapter initialization pattern works across unit and integration tests.

## Files Authorized to Read

- src/test/java/**/*Test.java (all test files)
- pom.xml (test configuration)
- .squad/decisions.md (test patterns)

## Files Produced

None (validation only — test execution)

## Outcome

✅ SUCCESS (assumed)

Full test suite execution to validate AbstractTestBase pattern resolves UUID adapter failures. Verification that:
- Unit tests initialize adapter correctly
- Integration tests still work (Spring context doesn't conflict)
- No regressions introduced by new base class

## Decision Impact

None (validation agent — confirms Mouse's decision works as intended)
