**Requested by:** Leonardo Moreira
**Task:** Extract 6 skills from TMS documentation (json-singleton, eventual-consistency, fake-repository, test-data-builder, immutable-aggregate-update, archunit-condition-reuse)
**Mode:** background
**Files touched:**
- Created: `.squad/skills/json-singleton-usage/SKILL.md`
- Created: `.squad/skills/eventual-consistency-pattern/SKILL.md`
- Created: `.squad/skills/fake-repository-pattern/SKILL.md`
- Created: `.squad/skills/test-data-builder-pattern/SKILL.md`
- Created: `.squad/skills/immutable-aggregate-update/SKILL.md`
- Created: `.squad/skills/archunit-condition-reuse/SKILL.md`
- Updated: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (added skill references)

**Outcome:** SUCCESS — 6 skills extracted with full metadata, examples, and confidence ratings. Skills provide direct retrieval paths for common TMS patterns, replacing multi-hop document searches. All skills validated against existing codebase examples.
