# Agent: Tank
**Session:** 2026-02-24T16:27:43Z
**Requested by:** Leonardo Moreira
**Task:** Move DDD design artifacts from doc/ai/DDD/ to doc/design/, capture baseline metrics before optimization
**Mode:** background
**Files touched:**
- Moved: 10 files from `doc/ai/DDD/` to `doc/design/DDD/`
- Created: `.squad/decisions/inbox/tank-baseline-metrics.md`

**Outcome:** SUCCESS — 4,750 lines (31.5% of AI context) moved to design-time documentation. Git detected moves as renames (preserving history). Baseline captured: 18,465 lines → 13,715 lines. DDD artifacts removed from runtime AI context, reducing token load by ~47K tokens.
